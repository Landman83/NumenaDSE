Numena Decentralized Securities Exchange

(work in progress as of 1/22/2025)

This is a fork of the DeepBook protocol, with an off-chain orderbook to maximize throughput and minimize latency of matching engine. Settlement will remain on-chain. 

Compliance features are not yet implemented, but will ensure tokens traded on exchange are compliant with American securities regulations in a manner similar to that implemented in the ERC-3643 protocol but adapted to the SUI blockchain to ensure high throughput and low fees.
